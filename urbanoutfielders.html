                I designed Urban Outfielders as a final project for my COGS 123 Social Computing class.
                In teams of 4, we came up with a novel social computing experience that was co-located and synchronous.
                We designed a mobile game for attending fans to predict the outcomes of each
                at-bat to enhance their ballgame experience.

                I went to a baseball game as part of checking out different social contexts.
                While there, I noticed regular lulls in action due to baseball's methodical game flow.
                Fans would fill these lulls by checking their phones, or interacting with other fans around
                them. Fans would interact with others through friendly and competitive banter, usually after
                the outcome of an at-bat. After the game, I conducted quick interviews with a few fans about
                their ballgame experience.

                I found 3 user needs that the app would need to satisfy:<br>
                <br><br>
                - <b><strong>Mobile device app</strong></b>. Users used their phones the most during breaks in play.<br>
                <br>
                - <b><strong>Easy &amp; quick use</strong></b>. The gaps between at-bats are very short.<br>
                <br>
                - <b><strong>Supplemental to game viewing</strong></b>. It must add to &amp; not interfere with the user's viewing of the game.<br>
                <br><br>
                With this in mind, the idea for a mobile game where fans pick their prediction for the outcome of the upcoming batter was born.
                Knowing fans were open to friendly competition, my teammates and I felt that this social computing experience would tap into people's desire to win.

                The initial prototype was set to be a minimal viable product that would test whether
                the outcome prediction game aspect was engaging to casual users. The initial prototype was made
                via Google Sheets, with drop-down menus of possible outcomes for users to choose for each at-bat
                or "Pick". The prototype was tested on a group of 16 students who were shown a live baseball game
                stream in a classroom. Some were die-hard fans, while others were casual fans, and
                some did not follow baseball at all.

                Users enjoyed the prototype testing session. They felt the game mechanism of selecting one's pick
                was quick, simple, and easy to use. During the testing session, users were drawn to the live ballgame
                as they watched whether their prediction would be right or not. Users naturally bantered with each
                other on outcomes of their picks.<br>
                <br>
                Users wanted the ability to compete in small groups so they could see how they stacked up against their friends.
                The next iteration of the prototype was designed to provide this experience.
                Via Google Sheets, the number of possible users was expanded to the class size (~100).
                Users were grouped by their TA/Discussion Section. The Rankings page was built so users could see
                their score along with all the other scores. A Results page was also constructed for testing purposes.
                The prototype was tested on a group of 100 students who were shown a live baseball game stream in a classroom.
                After each at-bat occurred, the outcome was coded in by the team. Doing so would update users' scores and
                the Rankings page accordingly.

                The second round of prototype testing was a success, with the larger group of users
                enjoying the experience. While the feedback the app received was positive, my teammates
                and I faced decision time on the app's direction. We decided against implementing a reward
                for top scores in order to maintain the app's goal of generating positive/friendly social interaction
                between fans via the human desire to be right and compete. Also, if a group of friends really wanted
                to have a prize for top score, they could always decide on a prize themselves (i.e. others pay for winner's
                dinner). <br>
                <br>
                We also decided against "surge points", or extra points for being correct on predicting "home run"
                or other high-impact plays. We wanted our game to reward smart guesses, not long-shot predictions.
                Also, some users made their picks early, with some picking 3 or 4 batters in advance. Meanwhile,
                some users changed their picks after the picking period had passed. Our solution was for the next
                prototype to present picks one-by-one and to have a locking mechanism so users can't change their
                picks once the play resumed.

              The next step was to figure out the app's structure and paths in order
              to guide the high-fidelity prototype. In order to keep the user onboarding
              process and app flow simple, we pivoted from implementing custom groups to
              age as a filter. Usually, friends are in the same age-group.<br>
              <br>
              Verifying the user's location at a game and simple identification information
              (for ranking purposes) would be the first thing presented to the user.
              Afterwards, a linear path of choosing picks, locking in, and seeing the
              outcome would be presented; the rankings were made present so that
              the user could always check up to see how they were faring against their peers.

                The high-fidelity prototype was our final project submission and made via
                InVision and guided by the information architecture. It was showcased to peers and
                voted in the Top 5. Sadly, my team did not develop the app further due to the course
                and school year ending and graduation.<br>
                <br>
                Hypothetically, the next steps would have been to implement competing in custom
                groups now that the core was in place. A potential solution is to have an invite system
                and in-group rankings page. Access to the group could be through user name invite. I enjoyed
                working on this project because the concept of social computing was engaging. I got to
                expand on my skills, especially prototyping. Seeing my classmates have fun with our prototypes
                was the cherry on top. Feel free to interact with the prototype the next time you go to the
                ballgame!<br>
